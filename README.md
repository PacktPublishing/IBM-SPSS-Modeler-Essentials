# IBM SPSS Modeler Essentials
This is the code repository for [IBM SPSS Modeler Essentials](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/ibm-spss-modeler-essentials?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788291118), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
IBM SPSS Modeler allows users to quickly and efficiently use predictive analytics and gain insights from your data. With almost 25 years of history, Modeler is the most established and comprehensive Data Mining workbench available. Since it is popular in corporate settings, widely available in university settings, and highly compatible with all the latest technologies, it is the perfect way to start your Data Science and Machine Learning journey.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



This book introduces students to the steps of data analysis. Students do not need to be
experienced in analyzing data; however, an introductory statistics or data mining course
would be helpful since this book's emphasis will be the point and click operations in
Modeler, and neither statistical nor data mining theory. We will carefully cover theory as
needed to help you understand why we are performing each of the steps in the case study,
so you can safely start with this book as your very first book. However, a single case study
will not provide a complete theoretical context for data mining and we will only use a
single modeling algorithm in any detail.
Software demonstrations will be performed on IBM SPSS Modeler; thus, having access to
Modeler is critical to enable you to follow along with step-by-step instructions. While we
recognize that you might make a first pass at this content away from your computer, you
should try each and every step in the book in Modeler. We have carefully narrowed the
material down to the essentials. You should find that every step will serve you well when
you apply what you've learned to your own data and your own situation. Since we've kept
it to the basics, you should have no problem completing the entire book during the time
period of a trial license of Modeler, if you do not have permanent access to Modeler. If you
encounter this material in a university setting, you may be eligible for a student version.
If you don't have Modeler yet, you might want to consider watching the Packt IBM SPSS
Modeler Essentials Video first, then installing the trial version, and then working through the
book step by step. Since the two case studies are different, this will provide excellent
reinforcement of the material. You will see virtually every concept twice, but with different
datasets.
